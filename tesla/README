These scripts can be used to fetch vehilce data from the Tesla Motors API

Access to the API is given by a stored cookie, which has to be generated 
using the provided script login.sh [loginname] [password]
The loginname and the password are the same as you use for the mytelsa website.

  login.sh whoever@example.com "supersecret password"

This login script generates the cookie file and shows the vehicle id which must
be set in the config script.


We use two Tesla Motors API endpoints to fetch data, so you have to add two
cron entries if you want to use all data. 

Example cron entires:
*/3 * * * * ~/00_private/PVLng-scripts/tesla/vehicle.sh ~/00_private/PVLng-scripts/tesla/tesla.conf
*/10 * * * * ~/00_private/PVLng-scripts/tesla/climate.sh ~/00_private/PVLng-scripts/tesla/tesla.conf
