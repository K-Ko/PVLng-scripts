curl_rc[1]="The URL you passed to libcurl used a protocol that this libcurl does not support. The support might be a compile-time option that you didn't use, it can be a misspelled protocol string or just a protocol libcurl has no code for."
curl_rc[2]="Very early initialization code failed. This is likely to be an internal error or problem, or a resource problem where something fundamental couldn't get done at init time."
curl_rc[3]="The URL was not properly formatted."
curl_rc[4]="A requested feature, protocol or option was not found built-in in this libcurl due to a build-time decision. This means that a feature or option was not enabled or explicitly disabled when libcurl was built and in order to get it to function you have to get a rebuilt libcurl."

curl_rc[6]="Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved."
curl_rc[7]="Failed to connect() to host or proxy."

curl_rc[10]="While waiting for the server to connect back when an active FTP session is used, an error code was sent over the control connection or similar."

curl_rc[15]="An internal failure to lookup the host used for the new connection."
curl_rc[17]="Received an error when trying to set the transfer mode to binary or ASCII."
curl_rc[18]="A file transfer was shorter or larger than expected. This happens when the server first reports an expected transfer size, and then delivers data that doesn't match the previously given size."

curl_rc[21]="When sending custom 'QUOTE' commands to the remote server, one of the commands returned an error code that was 400 or higher (for FTP) or otherwise indicated unsuccessful completion of the command."

curl_rc[33]="The server does not support or accept range requests."
curl_rc[34]="This is an odd error that mainly occurs due to internal confusion."

curl_rc[36]="The download could not be resumed because the specified offset was out of the file boundary."
curl_rc[37]="A file given with FILE:// couldn't be opened. Most likely because the file path doesn't identify an existing file. Did you check file permissions?"
