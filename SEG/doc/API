You will need to know some details of your tokens.

All the relevant details of your stuff can be found here:

Now, streams are that, streams of data, each with a point in time, and
a corresponding value. Streams are defined for units, i.e. kWh etc as part of
the stream type associated for the device.

1. The Resource is:

http://api.smartenergygroups.com/api_sites/stream

2. The Method to use is:
:PUT

3. The body of the request is:
data_post = "(site  <your site's site_token>
               (node <your device's node_name> <a date time stamp e.g. 2010-01-10T23:22:12 or a ? if you want SEG server time>
                 (<your devices stream_name> <value>)(<your devices stream_name> <value>)
               )
             )"

a working example for a device sending data to 4 streams on a device may be:

data_post = "(site 7adfe67f35a (node segmeter ? (p_1 567.00)(e_1 2.70)(p_2 402.00)(e_2 2.2)))"

or with the time specified

data_post = "(site 7adfe67f35a (node segmeter 2010-01-10T23:22:12 (p_1 567.00)(e_1 2.70)(p_2 402.00)(e_2 2.2)))"

The SEG server runs all data at UTC, so make sure to send UTC time -
that is unless you would like some headaches!

The Simple Stream API
---------------------

This API is designed for this type of device, it's a simple GET method to the
stream's resource, with the value on the parameter string, e.g.

http://api.smartenergygroups.com/api_streams/<stream_token>/add_point?value=47.2

This will add a data point to the stream identified by the <stream_token>
with the date time taken from the SEG server date time.  Simple!

You can get your stream_token from the my_keys, or by editiing your stream.

SEG API Response Codes

These are useful for working out what happened with your call to the SEG API.
Note the SEGbox uses these codes for seamless control and integration.

All is Ok

(status ok)                        Processed by SEG without fail
(status ok request_delayed)        SEG has the data, and it's in the queus for processing, usually because it's a large request.

Failure

(status fail seg_internal)         Fail in the SEG API, somepthing borked out, we may have caught it, retry the request.
(status fail invalid_site_token)   Self explainatory, your site could not be found!  Go check
(status fail no_data_sent)         Self explanatory, your request contained no useful data to process.
(status fail api_timeout)          The API timed out, retry
(status fail writing_response)     SEG could not write the response for some reason.
