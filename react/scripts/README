Put your scripts into this directory.

See dist/script.sh for reference.

Naming convention
=================

- <short config file>.<range id>.sh

config file: test.conf => without extension: test
range id   : 1
- test.1.sh

fallback
- test.0.sh

If no/empty channel reading could be found, the script with 
id 0 will be used as fallback.

This will be mostly a switch off/power down action to set your
controlled thing into a "save" mode.

It will overrule all other and will be overruled by all other!
