You can automatic create a ThingSpeak channel from a list of PVLng channel GUIDs.

Create a text file with the following content
1st line is your User API key, see https://thingspeak.com/account > API Key
2nd and all other the PVLng channel GUIDs to put into the ThingSpeak channel

Now run

$ ./createChannel.sh <TextFileName>

This will create
- the ThingSpeak channel
- a draft configuration file "TextFileName.conf"

Open your channels list in your browser and check the just created channel.
https://thingspeak.com/channels

You have to adjust afterwards in the created configuration file at least the
channels API key.
